For example: for some countries such as: USA, Canada, U.K and China that will be a \n good move and definitely they will get a lot of money to promote a healthy life style and different sports facilities.\n But also they will get some disadvantage the prices in Fast food will increase and still no one will not get any guaranty that customers \n won’t buy it anymore. So that must be a complex work.\n If the government increase taxes on fast food they have to decrease taxes \n to all those companies who are producing a health food. \n But in the same time the government must introduce lessons where the teachers will explain why fast foods are so dangerous for us.\n And even have some tours to hospitals where the children’s will have a chance talk to doctors and patients\n who have extra weight. They must see how they will look like if they are eating too much at fast food.\n In the same time the government have to cancel selling different types of soda, creeps, cookies and \n burgers, hot dogs at schools. 
So, in conclusion the government must increase taxes for fast foods. Because if we want to have a healthy society we must say no to fast foods. Health you can lose easily and you may not return it or buy it.
